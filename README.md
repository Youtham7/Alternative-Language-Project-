Which programming language and version did you pick? <br/> 
version 1.8.0. <br/>
Why did you pick this programming language? <br/> 
I picked Java because it's good at organizing data and widely used also a language that I learet along time ago and wanted to challange myself to see if can comple this <br/>
How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so.<br/>

Java fully supports object-oriented programming, easily reads files, uses clear if-else and switch for conditions, straightforward variable assignments.<br/>
List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.<br/>
For this project, I utilized Java's `java.util` package for efficient data management and collections, `java.io` for file operations to read and write data, and employed simple regular expressions for parsing CSV files instead of using external libraries to keep the solution lightweight.<br/>
